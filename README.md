# EDA-on-Terrorism-Dataset
I conducted an analysis utilizing a comprehensive global dataset on terrorist attacks. This analysis involved identifying the frequency of terrorist attacks on a country-by-country basis, as well as identifying the top 10 notorious terrorist groups involved in such attacks. Additionally, I analyzed the number of terrorist attacks that occurred annually.

However, it is important to note that this analysis was not without challenges. One of the primary challenges I faced was the state of the data, which was significantly disorganized and required a substantial amount of time to clean and prepare for analysis. In fact, approximately 40% of my time was dedicated to ensuring the data was suitable for analysis.
